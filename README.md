**Multitasking NLP Framework for Task A**

This repository contains an implementation of a multitasking framework for Task A, designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The framework includes data preprocessing, model training, and testing components to streamline multitask learning workflows.
Repository Structure
Dataset_TaskA: Directory containing the raw dataset files for Task A.
preprocessed_dataset: Directory containing the preprocessed dataset files.
README.md: Documentation file for this repository.
Submission.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for running the multitasking framework, including data loading, preprocessing, and model training.
multitasking-both-scaffold.py: Python script implementing the multitasking framework for both scaffold and main tasks.
test.py: Script for testing the model on unseen data or benchmark datasets.

**Setup and Usage**

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Required Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
torch
tqdm
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Install the dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dataset**
Place raw datasets in the Dataset_TaskA directory.
Run the preprocessing pipeline (Submission.ipynb or multitasking-both-scaffold.py) to generate the preprocessed dataset in the preprocessed_dataset directory.

**Running the Code**
For interactive exploration, use the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Submission.ipynb


To execute the multitasking framework script:
* python multitasking-both-scaffold.py


Test the model with:
* python test.py


Results and Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and task-specific metrics. Results will be displayed at the end of the training and testing scripts.
